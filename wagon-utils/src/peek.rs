/// A trait version of the functionality that [`Peekable`] provides.
///
/// Something like this has been in RFC for a while, but it's not getting implemented. 
/// For our own purposes, we implement it ourselves.
///
/// [`Peekable`] implements this trait by calling inner methods of the same name.
///
/// NOTE: The documentation of these methods are taken directly from the [`Peekable`] documentation.
/// your implementation of these methods may work differently. This is fine and expected, as long as you
/// know and document what you're doing and why.
pub trait Peek: Iterator {
    /// Returns a reference to the next() value without advancing the iterator.
    ///
    /// Like [`next`], if there is a value, it is wrapped in a `Some(T)`.
    /// But if the iteration is over, `None` is returned.
    ///
    /// [`next`]: Iterator::next
    ///
    /// Because `peek()` returns a reference, and many iterators iterate over
    /// references, there can be a possibly confusing situation where the
    /// return value is a double reference. You can see this effect in the
    /// examples below.

    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// Basic usage:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// let xs = [1, 2, 3];
    ///
    /// let mut iter = xs.iter().peekable();
